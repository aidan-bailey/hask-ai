# Hask AI
First foray into functional programming & logic for ai.

**Dependencies**

- [GHCi](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/GHCi) 
- [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

**Usage**

```cabal build``` to build the package.

```cabal repl``` loads modules into the GHCi for testing.


**Notes**

This repo is still very early in its development cycle. There is still much to be added (also not every user friendly yet (but it will be!)).
